### Hi there 👋

Welcome to my Github profile.  Some things you might want to know about me:

- 🎓 I'm a CS professor in my "other life"
- 🔬 My research focuses on 😈 security & 🎭 privacy
- 🍹 This year I'm on sabbatical, 🛠 building mobile apps to help regular people keep their friends, families, and communities' personal information safe online
- 🤠 I am from Texas 🌵
- I am enjoying programming in [Swift](https://swift.org/) -- Particularly with [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/) and [Vapor💧](https://vapor.codes/)
- I am building [Circles](https://github.com/KombuchaPrivacy/circles-ios), a new end-to-end encrypted social networking app with privacy built in from the start.
